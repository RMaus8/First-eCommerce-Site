                    <p name="aboutText"> On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled 
                    and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee 
                    the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
                    through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases
                    are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
                    and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
                    every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
                    business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise
                    man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
                    secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
